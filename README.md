# guessing_game
This Python code implements a number-guessing game. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user inputs guesses, and the program provides feedback to guess higher or lower until the correct number is entered. It counts the attempts and displays the number of tries taken to guess the correct number.
